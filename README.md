# My Priorities

 This is the second mini app in the free Udemy [React JS - Mastering Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-js-mastering-redux) course that I've used to get a base and expand on.

## Built With

* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* [redux](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* [react-redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html)
* [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose)
* [seamless-immutable](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable)
* [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* [bulma](http://bulma.io/)

## Running the tests

Tests have been written for the majority of the components, redux functionality and util functions.

```
  yarn test
```
